# Kidney-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to detect the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on medical attributes such as blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, and more.

 Key Highlights:
1) Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
2) Outlier Detection & Feature Engineering
3) Model Training with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
4) Implemented Voting Classifier (Ensemble Learning) to combine multiple models for better accuracy
